### Summary
This blueprint deploys a vSphere Event Broker Appliance (VEBA) from an .ova that
is available via http. In this case it's hosted on an Minio based object server.
As part of the deployment the VEBA is connected to an existing vCenter.

### Usage:
This Blueprint can be launched manually but it's often preferable to launch via
Code Stream such that the inputs can be added in the Code Stream pipeline rather
than having to type them in each time.

Note: You may need to make some tweaks to the networking settings depending on
your network profile configuration.
